# @zendeskgarden/react-grid [![npm version](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/@zendeskgarden/react-grid.svg?style=flat-square)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@zendeskgarden/react-grid)

This package includes components relating to layout grids in the
[Garden Design System](https://zendeskgarden.github.io/).

The `Grid` component is inspired by the Bootstrap flexbox
[grid](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.3/layout/grid/). With Garden, all of
the features are dynamic (based on props) â€“ including the number of grid
columns and gutter width. The result is an incredibly powerful grid system
that will be immediately familiar to users of Bootstrap.

npm install @zendeskgarden/react-grid
