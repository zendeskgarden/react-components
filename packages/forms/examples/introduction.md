The `@zendeskgarden/react-forms` packages provides high-abstraction components to
help create consistent, accessible, and flexible form fields.

It provides dynamic styling and accessibility attributes from the [@zendeskgarden/container-field](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@zendeskgarden/container-field)
via the [React Context API](https://reactjs.org/docs/context.html).

### Customization and State Management

All components within this package spread their provided props to their respective DOM elements.
Each form field is backed by a standard `<input />` element and can be controlled in the same way.

```jsx static
const Example = () => {
  const [value, setValue] = React.useState('');

  return (
    <Field>
      <Label data-custom-value="this-is-available">Custom Label</Label>
      <Input value={value} onChange={e => setValue(e.target.value)} />
    </Field>
  );
};
```
