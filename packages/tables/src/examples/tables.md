components that extend the native table elements: `<table>`,
`<tbody>`, `<tr>`, `<td>`, etc.

When building a table with the `react-tables` package follow
the [MDN Table Accessibility Practices](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/HTML/Tables/Advanced#Tables_for_visually_impaired_users)
guidelines to ensure your implementation is accessible to screen-readers.
