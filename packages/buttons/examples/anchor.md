The `Anchor` component is a styled `<a>` tag. It accepts all standard anchor
props and should only be used for navigating to a resource. If you need a
`<button>` that has anchor styling, use the `<Button link>anchor-styled button</Button>` component.

```jsx
<div>
  Apparently we had reached a great height in the
  <Anchor href="#button">atmosphere</Anchor>, for the sky was a dead black, and the stars had ceased
  to twinkle. By the same
  <Anchor href="https://www.zendesk.com" target="_blank" external>
    illusion which lifts the horizon
  </Anchor>{' '}
  of the sea to the level of the spectator on a hillside, the sable cloud beneath was dished out,
  and the car seemed to float in the middle of an
  <Anchor href="https://www.zendesk.com" target="_blank" external>
    immense dark sphere
  </Anchor>, whose upper half was strewn with silver. Looking down into the dark gulf below, I could
  see a <Anchor href="#chevronbutton">ruddy light streaming</Anchor> through a rift in the clouds.
</div>
```

### External anchor sizing

```jsx
const { SM, MD, LG, XL, XXL } = require('@zendeskgarden/react-typography');

const AnchorExample = () => (
  <Anchor href="https://www.zendesk.com" target="_blank" external>
    External Anchor
  </Anchor>
);

<div>
  <SM>
    <AnchorExample />
  </SM>
  <MD>
    <AnchorExample />
  </MD>
  <LG>
    <AnchorExample />
  </LG>
  <XL>
    <AnchorExample />
  </XL>
  <XXL>
    <AnchorExample />
  </XXL>
</div>;
```
