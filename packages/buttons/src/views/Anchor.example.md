The `Anchor` component is a styled `<a>` tag. It accepts all standard anchor props and should
only be used for navigating to a resource.

If you need a `<button>` that has anchor styling, use the
`<Button link>Anchor styled button</Button>` component.

```jsx
<div>
  Apparently we had reached a great height in the
  <Anchor href="https://www.zendesk.com" target="_blank">
    atmosphere
  </Anchor>, for the sky was a dead black, and the stars had ceased to twinkle. By the same
  <Anchor href="https://www.zendesk.com" target="_blank">
    illusion which lifts the horizon
  </Anchor>
  of the sea to the level of the spectator on a hillside, the sable cloud beneath was dished out,
  and the car seemed to float in the middle of an
  <Anchor href="https://www.zendesk.com" target="_blank">
    immense dark sphere
  </Anchor>, whose upper half was strewn with silver. Looking down into the dark gulf below, I could
  see a
  <Anchor href="https://www.zendesk.com" target="_blank">
    ruddy light streaming
  </Anchor> through a rift in the clouds.
</div>
```
