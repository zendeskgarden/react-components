The `ButtonGroupView` component by itself is a simple, presentation component without any
selection logic. For real-world usages it should be used with
the `ButtonGroup` or `ButtonGroupContainer` components.

### Standard Button Group (no logic)

```jsx
<ButtonGroupView>
  <Button>Button 1</Button>
  <Button>Button 2</Button>
  <Button>Button 3</Button>
</ButtonGroupView>
```
