The `<Datepicker>` takes a native `Date()` object as its input. It is able to
accept several varieties of user input to parse it's date. By default it
allows the standard `Date.parse()` formats, including:

- `09/04/1986`
- `Sep 4, 1986`
- `September 4th, 1986`

These values are localized and will change their format based on the provided locale.
This logic may be customized with the `customParseDate` prop to allow more advanced
date parsing with [momentjs](https://momentjs.com/) or [date-fns](https://date-fns.org/).

```jsx
const { Field, Label, Input } = require('@zendeskgarden/react-forms/src');

initialState = {
  value: new Date()
};

<Field>
  <Label>Select a date</Label>
  <Datepicker value={state.value} onChange={newDate => setState({ value: newDate })}>
    <Input />
  </Datepicker>
</Field>;
```
