## Render calendar in a root level React portal

The `appendToNode` property can be used to render the calendar in a different
DOM location than inline with the DatePicker component. This is done via React
portals under the hood.

You typically will need to set this property if you are using the `DatePicker`
inside an element with `overflow: hidden` / `auto` / `scroll` CSS styles.

See in this example, that the calendar is currently getting cropped. Enable the
`appendToNode` property to see the full calendar.

<Canvas>
  <Story of={PatternsStories.Calendar} />
</Canvas>
