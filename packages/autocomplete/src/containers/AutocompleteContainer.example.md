The `AutocompleteContainer` is a render prop container that abstracts the positioning and accessibility
logic of a standard autocomplete and supports two common implementations:

- [Autocomplete Select](#autocomplete)
- [Multi-Select](#multi-select)

Due to the wide variety of customizations and the assumed complexity of creating an autocomplete,
this package contains **no visual elements**.

The examples below show two common layouts using assorted Garden packages:

- [@zendeskgarden/react-textfields](/react-components/textfields/)
- [@zendeskgarden/react-menus](/react-components/menus/)
- [@zendeskgarden/react-tags](/react-components/tags/)

### WARNING

This package comes _"with some assembly required"_
