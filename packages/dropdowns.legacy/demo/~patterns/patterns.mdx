## Render menu in a root level React portal

The `appendToNode` property can be used to render the menu in a different
DOM location than inline with the Trigger component. This is done via React
portals under the hood.

You typically will need to set this property if you are using the `Menu` inside
an element with `overflow: hidden` / `auto` / `scroll` CSS styles.

See in this example, that the menu is currently getting cropped. Change the
`appendToNode` property to "portal" to see the full menu.

<Canvas>
  <Story of={PatternsStories.Menu} />
</Canvas>
