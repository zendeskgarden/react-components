# Garden Migration Guide

## v9

### Breaking Changes

The theme object, along with its utility functions, introduce a minimal set of
breaking changes for Garden version 9. It is important to proceed with caution
when upgrading each Garden package individually. All existing v8 packages must
be
[v8.75.0](https://github.com/zendeskgarden/react-components/releases/tag/v8.75.0)
or higher in order to complete a successful individual package migration to v9.
Detailed theming change instructions are provided under the
[@zendeskgarden/react-theming](#zendeskgardenreact-theming) package.

Garden has transitioned from utilizing [Popper](https://popper.js.org/docs/) to
adopting the enhanced [Floating UI](https://floating-ui.com/) library. In the
past, Popper's [modifiers](https://popper.js.org/docs/v2/modifiers/) were
directly accessible as component props, creating a rigid dependency that
hindered updates to the positioning library. To address this, these properties
have been removed since Floating UI is designed to intuitively handle component
positioning in the majority of scenarios. Should you find yourself in need of
specific functionality provided by the former modifiers, we encourage you to
file an [issue](https://github.com/zendeskgarden/react-components/issues),
making sure to mention the relevant Floating UI
[middleware](https://floating-ui.com/docs/middleware) for clarity. Garden will
consider additional positioning prop support on a case-by-case basis.

#### All Packages

- Garden v9 packages use `styled-components` version range `^5.3.1`.

  - `react-theming@v9` uses version range `^4.2.0 || ^5.3.1` to support `v8` to `v9` upgrades.

- Garden v9 upgraded from `react-merge-refs` v1 to v2.
  - The [breaking
    change](https://github.com/gregberge/react-merge-refs/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md#200-2022-06-19)
    exports ESM only.
  - Build and test pipelines may need to be updated to account for the `.mjs`
    extension. See Garden's
    [jest.config.js](https://github.com/zendeskgarden/react-components/blob/c2aa97d1edccfa0578ee5655b543ca6635767fb9/utils/test/jest.config.js#L28-L30)

     `getFocusBoxShadow` theming utilities, or

- All subcomponent exports have been deprecated and will be removed in a future major version.
  Update to subcomponent properties (e.g., `Tabs.TabList`).

#### @zendeskgarden/react-theming

- The default `theme` object has removed values for `colors.background` and
  `colors.foreground`. Use the `'background.default'` and `'foreground.default'`
  variables together with the v9 `getColor` utility instead.
- The theming `palette` has undergone a comprehensive redesign and now includes
  enhanced support for both light and dark modes. To facilitate a smoother
  transition, we have introduced a temporary utility, `getColorV8`, which is
  deprecated. This utility enables the application of the legacy version 8 color
  scheme to custom components that are not part of the Garden framework. It is
  recommended to utilize this stopgap measure until such components can be updated
  to leverage the full capabilities of v9 `getColor`.
- The `focusVisibleRef` prop (and the resulting scoping `<div>`) has been
  removed from `<ThemeProvider>`. Current browser support obviates the need for a
  `:focus-visible` polyfill.
- Utility function `getColor` has been refactored with a signature that supports
  v9 light/dark modes. Replace usage with `getColorV8` until custom components can
  be upgraded to utilize the new `getColor` function.
- Utility function `getDocument` has been removed. Use `useDocument` instead.
- Utility function `isRtl` has been removed. Use `props.theme.rtl` instead.
- The following exports have changed:
  - removed `retrieveTheme`. Use `retriveComponentStyles` instead.
  - constants prefixed with `ARRAY_` no longer have a prefix.
- The following types have changed:
  - renamed `ARROW_POSITION` to `ArrowPosition`
  - renamed `MENU_POSITION` to `MenuPosition`

#### @zendeskgarden/react-tooltips

- `Tooltip`
  - removed `eventsEnabled` prop (no longer exposed by Floating UI)
  - removed `popperModifiers` prop (see [note](#breaking-changes))
- All subcomponent exports have been deprecated and will be removed in a future major version.
  Update to subcomponent properties (e.g., `Tooltip.Title`).

#### @zendeskgarden/react-typography

- The following React component types have changed:
  - `Span.Icon`: `HTMLAttributes<HTMLElement>` -> `SVGAttributes<SVGElement>`
  - `Span.StartIcon`: `HTMLAttributes<HTMLElement>` -> `SVGAttributes<SVGElement>`

#### @zendeskgarden/react-utilities

- Migrate to `@zendeskgarden/container-utilities` and `@zendeskgarden/react-theming` to continue
  receiving updates.
