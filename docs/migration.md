# Garden Migration Guide

## v8

### Overview

The upgrade to Garden v8 is designed to allow you to upgrade each package individually. It is not
necessary to upgrade all Garden packages to v8 at once. Each upgrade step can be completed in
isolation.

### Upgrade Steps

- Upgrade all existing Garden React dependencies to their [latest `v7`](https://github.com/zendeskgarden/react-components/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#v700-2019-10-17)
  version.
- Upgrade `@zendeskgarden/react-theming` to `v8`.
  - `react-theming@v8` includes breaking changes. Refer to the
    [Breaking Changes](#breaking-changes) section for specific upgrade instructions.
  - `react-theming@v8` is a valid peerDependency for all `v7` packages.
- Upgrade all other `@zendeskgarden/react-*` packages to `v8` individually.
  - These upgrades included several breaking changes. Refer to the [Breaking Changes](#breaking-changes)
    section for specific upgrade instructions.

### Breaking Changes

#### All packages

- Garden v8 packages use CSS-in-JS and no longer provide CSS files.
  - Remove all Garden React CSS imports.
  - i.e `@zendeskgarden/react-buttons/dist/styles.css`
- All themable component IDs (`data-garden-id` attributes) have been renamed for consistency across
  all packages.
- Any custom theming provided to the `ThemeProvider` component should be checked for accuracy.
- Garden v8 packages no longer provide UMD bundles.

  - Use `Avatar.Text` instead.
- New props to ease color control: `surfaceColor`, `backgroundColor`, and `foregroundColor`.

#### @zendeskgarden/react-breadcrumbs

- The `Item` component has been removed.
