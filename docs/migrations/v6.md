# Garden Migration Guide

## v6

### Breaking Change Details

#### New versioning strategy

- Garden React packages are now published under a shared, fixed (common major) version number
- You are still able to upgrade packages individually
- This change will help us better communicate changes and allows consumers to better understand the state of their dependencies
- This is the first release under the new versioning strategy, **v6.0.0**

#### New peer dependencies

From **v6.0.0** all Garden React libraries now require the following peer dependencies:

```bash
react@^16.8.0
react-dom@^16.8.0
styled-components@^4.2.0
@zendeskgarden/react-theming@^6.0.0
```

[React v16 upgrade docs](https://reactjs.org/blog/2017/09/26/react-v16.0.html)
[styled-components v4 upgrade docs](https://www.styled-components.com/docs/faqs#what-do-i-need-to-do-to-migrate-to-v4)

Beginning with v4, styled-components now uses the [React.forwardRef](https://reactjs.org/docs/react-api.html#reactforwardref) API.

This means that all existing `innerRef`, `menuRef`, `buttonRef`, etc. props are now replaced with `ref`.

#### How to upgrade

1. Upgrade `react` and `react-dom` to `latest`
2. Upgrade all Garden dependencies to their most recent, pre v6 versions
3. Upgrade styled-components and all Garden dependencies to `latest`
4. Correct all `innerRef`, `buttonRef`, `menuRef`, etc. usages based on the [styled-components v4 upgrade docs](https://www.styled-components.com/docs/faqs#what-do-i-need-to-do-to-migrate-to-v4)
