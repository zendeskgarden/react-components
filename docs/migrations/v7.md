# Garden Migration Guide

## v7

### Breaking Changes

#### `react-loaders`

- The `Dots` and `Spinner` components no longer accept a `velocity` prop
  - To customize the speed of the animation use the `duration` prop to provide the time in MS.

#### `react-pagination`

- The `focusedKey` prop is no longer accepted
  - This state is no longer controllable
- The `onStateChange` prop is no longer accepted
  - Use the `onChange` prop to receive `currentPage` updates.

#### `react-tabs`

- The `selectedKey` prop has been renamed to `selectedItem`
  - This API now aligns with other components
- All `<TabPanel>` components now require an `item` prop instead of a `key` prop
  - Previously we used the `key` attribute to uniquely identify each tab
  - This created confusion as `key` is also a reserved prop name in React
- The `onStateChange` prop is no longer valid
  - Use the `onChange` prop to receive `selectedItem` updates

#### Removal of deprecated packages

The following deprecated packages have been removed from the repository and will not be upgraded to `v7`:

- `@zendeskgarden/react-autocomplete`
  - Migrate to the `@zendeskgarden/react-dropdowns` package
- `@zendeskgarden/react-checkboxes`
  - Migrate to the `@zendeskgarden/react-forms` package
- `@zendeskgarden/react-menus`
- Migrate to the `@zendeskgarden/react-dropdowns` package
- `@zendeskgarden/react-radios`
  - Migrate to the `@zendeskgarden/react-forms` package
- `@zendeskgarden/react-ranges`
  - Migrate to the `@zendeskgarden/react-forms` package
- `@zendeskgarden/react-select`
  - Migrate to the `@zendeskgarden/react-dropdowns` package
- `@zendeskgarden/react-textfields`
  - Migrate to the `@zendeskgarden/react-forms` package
- `@zendeskgarden/react-toggles`
  - Migrate to the `@zendeskgarden/react-forms` package

#### Removal of deprecated Render-Prop Containers

In previous versions we have included render-prop containers for
the common UX patterns provided in our components. To help make these
assets more flexible, we have created a new repository [react-containers](https://github.com/zendeskgarden/react-containers).

In `v7` all render-prop containers (`*Container`) has been moved to standalone packages.
These containers are now available as standard React Hooks as well as render-props.

### Migration Steps

- Upgrade all Garden React dependencies to their latest `v6.x` version
- Check your console and testing environments to see if any deprecation warnings can be seen
- Remove any usages of deprecated packages and containers
- Upgrade all Garden React dependencies to their latest `v7.x` version
- Update any `react-tabs`, `react-pagination`, and `react-loaders` usages affected by the breaking changes listed above

For this breaking change we were able to allow an open range for our peer dependency of `react-theming` to allow `v6` and `v7` versions.

This allows you to upgrade each package individually if necessary, ending with `react-theming`.
If you have any questions about this process please open an issue.
