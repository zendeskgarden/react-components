# v8.0.0

NOTE: many style-related COMPONENT_IDs were renamed for consistency based
on the CSS-in-JS restructure. All component-level theming customizations
should be re-checked for ID naming accuracy.

## @zendeskgarden/react-autocomplete

- removed; see `@zendeskgarden/react-dropdowns`

## @zendeskgarden/react-avatars

- no longer packages a `styles.css` dist; CSS is self-contained
- removed child `Text` export
  - previously `Text`; currently `Avatar.Text`
- FEATURES: `surfaceColor`, `backgroundColor`, and `foregroundColor` props to ease color control

## @zendeskgarden/react-breadcrumbs

- The `<Item>` component has been removed. The `<Breadcrumb>` component determines the last
  breadcrumb item and applies styling to each item. Instead of passing `<Item>` components as
  children to `<Breadcrumb>`, consumers can now pass in inline elements of their choice. For example,
  a child of `<Breadcrumb>` can be a `<span>` or a component that renders an `<a>`.

  - `link` -> `isLink`
  - `pill` -> `isPill`

  it passes `selectedItem` directly rather than nesting it in an object
- `ButtonGroup` now requires it's children to contain a `value` prop which is returned when selected
- removed `min-width` CSS per design intent

## @zendeskgarden/react-chrome

- No longer packages a `styles.css` dist; CSS is self-contained
- All irrelevant state and layout styling props (focused, hovered, etc.) have been removed
- The `Nav` component no longer takes a `dark` or `light` prop. Use the `Chrome` component
  `hue` prop to apply a custom color. The component will dynamically change navigation
  styling to create an accessible contrast level

## @zendeskgarden/react-grid

      breakpoint. If you need these four `max-width` CSS properties across the
      small, medium, large, and extra-large breakpoints, either use Bootstrap's
      `.container` or add them to your application.
  - Removed Row `gutters`; use `<Grid gutters={false}>` instead
  - Removed invalid Col `justifyContent`; use Row `justifyContent` for alignment

New features/fixes include:

- Ability to resize gutters (default = 20px)
- Ability to set number of columns (default = 12)
- Added Col `offset` and fixed RTL across all offsets
- Added Row `alignContent` prop
- Most Row/Col props accept responsive variants for targeting screen size breakpoints
