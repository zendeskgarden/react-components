# Garden React Components [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/zendeskgarden/react-components.svg?token=dDt9s6smCMgz269xNbpz&branch=master)](https://travis-ci.com/zendeskgarden/react-components)

> :seedling: Garden is a design system for Zendesk

Garden React provides consistent behavior for Garden components.
React components are maintained following a multi-package approach where
components are packaged and published individually, but combined under
this single repository. Components rely on Garden
[CSS](https://github.com/zendeskgarden/css-components) for styling.

## Installation

See the individual package README for the React component you would like
to install.

See [package registry
documentation](https://github.com/zendeskgarden/LANDSCAPE/wiki/Package-Registry)
for the configuration needed to install `@zendesk`-scoped packages as
dependencies in your own program.

## Usage

To consume our packages we require [CSS-modules](https://github.com/css-modules/css-modules) be enabled within your webpack config. This allows us to leverage the styling that currently exists within our [CSS packages](https://github.com/zendeskgarden/css-components).

By not bundling the CSS with each package it ensures that tree-shaking is handled correctly with products that depend on the CSS for other, custom areas.

### Webpack configuration

Use this configuration to enable CSS-modules globally.

```js
// webpack >= 2.2.1
{
  test: /\.css$/,
  use: [
    'style-loader',
    {
      loader: 'css-loader',
      options: {
        modules: true,
        localIdentName: '[path][name]__[local]--[hash:base64:5]'
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

### Limited Webpack Configuration

This configuration limits CSS-modules to the Garden React packages. Useful if you are already using global CSS within your application.

```js
// webpack >= 2.2.1
{
  test: /\.css$/,
  include: /node_modules\/@zendesk\/garden-css/, // limits imports affected by loader
  use: [
    'style-loader',
    {
      loader: 'css-loader',
      options: {
        modules: true,
        localIdentName: '[path][name]__[local]--[hash:base64:5]'
      }
    }
  ]
}
```
